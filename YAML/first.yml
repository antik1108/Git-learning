#what is YAML?
#YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable data serialization format

#Why use YAML?
#1. Readability: YAML is designed to be easy to read and write, making it ideal for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures.
#2. Simplicity: YAML has a simple syntax that is easy to understand, which can help reduce errors and improve maintainability.
#3. Flexibility: YAML supports a wide range of data types and structures, including lists, dictionaries, and sets, making it suitable for a variety of applications.
#4. Language Support: YAML is supported by many programming languages, making it a popular choice for configuration files and data serialization in various software projects.

#Where is YAML used?
#1. Configuration Files: YAML is commonly used for configuration files in software applications, such as for web servers, databases, and application settings.
#2. Data Serialization: YAML is used for data serialization, allowing data to be easily stored and transmitted between different systems and programming languages.
#3. DevOps and Infrastructure as Code: YAML is widely used in DevOps tools and infrastructure as code platforms, such as Ansible, Kubernetes, and Docker Compose, for defining infrastructure and application configurations.

#Why GitHub uses YAML for its Actions?
#GitHub uses YAML for its Actions because of its readability, simplicity, and flexibility. 
#YAML allows developers to easily define workflows and configurations for their GitHub Actions in a clear and concise manner. 
#The use of YAML also enables GitHub Actions to be easily integrated with other tools and services, making it a popular choice for automating tasks and workflows in software development projects hosted on GitHub.

#Basic rules of YAML:
#1. YAML is case-sensitive.
#2. YAML uses indentation to indicate nesting. Indentation is typically done with Two spaces (not tabs).
#3. YAML supports comments, which start with the # character and continue to the end of the line.
#4. YAML uses a key-value pair format, where keys are followed by a colon and a space, and then the value.
#5. YAML supports various data types, including strings, integers, floats, booleans, null values, lists (arrays), dictionaries (maps), and sets.



##### data_types in yml:
#   - string
#   - integer
#   - float
#   - boolean
#   - null 

#strings in yml:
name: Antik Mondal #This is a string
name_with_quotes: "Antik Mondal" #This is also a string, but with double quotes
name_with_single_quotes: 'Antik Mondal' #This is also a string, but with single quotes
name_with_special_characters: "Antik Mondal's YAML" #This string contains a special character (apostrophe)
name_with_escaped_characters: "Antik Mondal\nYAML" #This string contains an escaped newline character
name_with_multiline: "Antik Mondal\nYAML\nExample" #This string spans multiple lines using escaped newline characters
name_with_unicode: "Antik Mondal \u2764" #This string contains a Unicode character (heart symbol)
multi_line_string: |
  This is a multi-line string.
  It can span multiple lines without needing special characters.
  Each new line will be preserved in the output.
multi_line_string_with_indent: >
  This is another multi-line string.
  It will be folded into a single line, with newlines replaced by spaces.
  Indentation will be preserved.

#integers, floats, booleans, and null values in yml:
age: 30 #This is an integer
height: 5.9 #This is a float

is_student: false #This is a boolean
is_employed: yes #This is also a boolean (YAML recognizes "yes" as true)
is_married: no #This is also a boolean (YAML recognizes "no" as false)

address: null #This is a null value
additional_info: ~ #This is also a null value (YAML recognizes "~" as null)

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#
######time and date in yml:
birthdate: 2005-08-11 #This is a year-month-day format date
birth: 2005-08-11 00:21:59 #date with time in year-month-day hour:minute:second format
appointment_time: 2024-06-01T14:30:00Z #This is a datetime in ISO 8601 format - {for me understanding this format is a bit tricky, but it represents a specific point in time (June 1, 2024, at 14:30 UTC)}
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#


#####In YAML, collections are used to group multiple values together. There are three main types of collections: lists (arrays), dictionaries (maps), and sets.
###collections in yml:
hobbies: #This is a list (array) of strings
  - coding
  - Traveling
  - teaching
  - true 
# tams_hobbies: [bokbok, sleeping, raguragu] #This is the same list but in inline format

#nested list:
nested_hobbies:
  - outdoor:
      - hiking
      - biking
  - indoor:
      - reading
      - cooking
#------------------------------------#
###dictionaries (maps) in yml:
favorite_colors: #This is a dictionary (map) of key-value pairs
  primary: blue
  secondary: green
  tertiary: red

#nested dictionary:
favorite_foods: #This is another dictionary with more complex values  
  breakfast: 
    - eggs
    - toast
    - coffee
  lunch: 
    - sandwich
    - salad
  dinner: 
    main_course: pasta
    dessert: ice cream
#------------------------------------#
#!!set what is this?
#In YAML, !!set is a special data type that represents a set, which is an unordered collection of unique values. When you use !!set, it indicates that the values should be treated as a set rather than a list or dictionary. In the example below, we have defined a set called unique_id that contains two unique values: 12345 and 67890. The use of !!set ensures that these values are treated as a set, meaning that they are unique and do not have any specific order.
unique_id: !!set
  ? 12345
  ? 67890

#####what is this? anchors and merge keys in yml:
default_settings: &default_base #This is an ##anchor## that can be reused later
  theme: light
  notifications: true

#what is <<? 
# Answer: The << is a merge key in YAML that allows you to merge the contents of one mapping (dictionary) into another. It is often used in conjunction with anchors (&) to reuse and extend configurations without having to duplicate the same values multiple times. 
#In the example below, we have defined a default_settings anchor with some base settings, and then we use the << merge key to include those settings in phone_settings, laptop_settings, and tablet_settings, while also allowing for overrides where necessary.

phone_settings:
  <<: *default_base #This is a merge key that includes the values from the default_settings anchor 
laptop_settings:
  <<: *default_base #This is another merge key that includes the values from the default_settings anchor
  os: windows 

tablet_settings:
  <<: *default_base #This is yet another merge key that includes the values from the default_settings anchor
  theme: dark #Here we are overriding the theme value from the default_settings anchor to dark for tablet_settings. 
              #So here in the tablet_settings, the theme will be dark instead of light, while in phone_settings and laptop_settings, the theme will remain light as defined in the default_settings anchor.

###This topic is little bit tricky lets understand it with another example:

# What is anchors and aliases in YAML?
#In YAML, anchors and aliases are used to reuse and reference values within the same document.
#An anchor is defined using the & symbol followed by a name, and it allows you to assign a name to a value or a collection of values. 
#An alias is defined using the * symbol followed by the name of the anchor, and it allows you to reference the value or collection of values that were assigned to the anchor.
#example of aliases and anchors in YAML:
person1: &person_anchor #This is an anchor that assigns the name "person_anchor" to the value of person1
  name: Antik Mondal
  age: 30
  city: New York
person2: #This is an alias that references the value of the person_anchor
  <<: *person_anchor #This is a merge key that includes the values from the person_anchor
  name: Tams #Here we are overriding the name value from the person_anchor to Tams for person2. So person2 will have the same age and city as person1, but the name will be different (Tams instead of Antik Mondal).

##### !!explicit data types in yml:
zip_code: !!str 12345 #forcing a value to be treated as a string, even if it looks like a number.
count: !!int "10" #forcing a value to be treated as an integer, even if it's provided as a string.
