# Git Learning

This repository contains my **initial Git & GitHub learning notes**.

When I started learning Git, I only knew a few basic commands like:

- `git init`
- `git add .`
- `git commit`
- `git push`

I didn’t really understand how Git worked internally or how to use it properly in real projects.  
So I started writing notes, saving screenshots, and practicing commands.  

This repo is a collection of those **early learnings**, kept in a simple and honest form.
